# About

### Grey Software promotes freedom and collaboration in software.

**We do this by:**

- Creating free apps and tools to improve the open-source software ecosystem
- Helping students learn software engineering by collaborating with open source maintainers.

## 👁️‍ Vision 

### _We envision an open source future where software maintainers mentor students and build free software together._

## 🧭 How we get there

**To realize our vision, we need to address the issues facing maintainers and students.**

### Maintainers are burnt out

Because as open-source adoption accelerates, so do the demands on their time. To see their projects flourish, they need sustainable income and passionate contributors.

We're improving the open source software ecosystem by creating useful, creative, and free software with the world's latest technology.

### Students crave real world experience

Because it plays an important role when they’re recruited into the modern tech economy. 

**Grey Software is currently exploring two avenues for adressing these issues**

1. We're creating open-source apps that students can contribute to with guidance and structure from a mentor under our [_Apprentice Program_](./apprentice-program). 

2. We're seeking to run an experimental educational program with universities and open source maintainers. In this program, maintainers will be offered university teaching contracts to mentor students in a project course setting. Thus, students get real-world experience, and maintainers can make a sustainable living while developing open-source software. Check out [our proposed model](https://tiny.cc/gs-bm)
